# semantic_segmentation
Created a Fully connected neural Network of Scene understanding binary classification. The classifier classifies each pixel as navigable space on road  or not.

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset

Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py


##### Observations

The model performs very well except in some cases where it includes parts of car's tires and other corner cases. 
Some of the examples of the output are shown in few_output_images folder.
